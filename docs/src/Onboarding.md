# Onboarding

## Your Sponsored Account

Every DSPG fellow and intern will have access to a UVA [Sponsored Account](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=8fec94fcdb296b4c2192e6650596199b).

A sponsored account will receive a UVA computing ID (e.g., `jbs3hp`).

!!! info

    Your UVA email address will be your UVA computing ID as the username at the `virginia.edu` domain (e.g., `jbs3hp@virginia.edu`).
    The name in the Global Address Listing (GAL) in Outlook will be
    > Surname, Given Name (Computing ID)
    based on your preferred name.

!!! tip

    Your legal name will be prepopulated but you may update your preferred name. For example, names that use non ASCII characters such as accents might prefer to update their preferred name to their ASCII map through [Update Personal Information](https://in.virginia.edu/updateinfo) for compatibility with some of the systems.
