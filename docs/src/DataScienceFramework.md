The Data Science Framework
==========================

Our foundation for doing data science is Keller et al. ([2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.2d83f7f5)) data science framework which is well illustrated with figure 1 of the article.

Throughout the DSPG program every participant will be applying the framework to their projects.
