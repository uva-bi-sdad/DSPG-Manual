# The Data Science Framework

The Data Science for the Public Good Young Scholars program will have teams work on various research projects. While each project will have its idiosyncrasies, the typical approach will be rooted in the Data Science Framework (Keller, Lancaster, and Shipp [2017](https://doi.org/10.1080/2330443X.2017.1374897); Keller et al. [2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.2d83f7f5); [2018](https://doi.org/10.1002/wics.1426)).
