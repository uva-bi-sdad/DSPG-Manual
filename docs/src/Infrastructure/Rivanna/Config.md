# Various Configurations

## Configure your shell

Your `~/.bashrc` file should look like

```
# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
	. /etc/bashrc
fi

PS1="\s-\v\$"
alias vi='vim'
```

consider adding the following lines,

```
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
export TZ='America/New_York'
export PGHOST=postgis1
export DB_USR={computing_id}
export DB_PWD={db_pwd}
ml >/dev/null 2>&1 && ml git/2.4.1 anaconda/2019.10-py3.7 julia/1.3.1 gcc/7.1.0 openmpi/3.1.4 R/3.6.1
```

replacing `{computing_id}` and `{DB_PWD}` with your computing ID and the `postgres1` database password for your role.

## Configuring Git / GitHub

!!! warning

    This session assumes you have already sign-up for GitHub and added your UVA email as a verified email address. If you have not done so yet, see the GitHub session before continuing.

## Configuring an SSH key with GitHub

You can generate an SSH key in Rivanna which you may use for SSH connections (e.g., Git cloning using the SSH protocol from GitHub).

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "{computing_id}@virginia.edu"
```

accept the default path (e.g., `/home/{computing_id}/.ssh/*`).

!!! tip

	You should enable a password for your SSH keys!

You can inspect the public key by
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

and then follow the [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) for adding the key to GitHub.

## Configuring a GPG key with GitHub

!!! tip

	The recommended approach is for having a GPG key per email identity. You can generate on Rivanna or in your sysytem and import it to Rivanna. For DSPG related work, we recommend signing every commit with a GPG key that does not does not expire associated to your UVA email address.

### Generating a GPG key in Rivanna

You add a GPG to your GitHub account for signing your Git commits.

To generate a GPG key in Rivanna, from a Rivanna [shell](https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/pun/sys/shell/ssh/rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu) (available through the `Rivanna Shell Access` under `Clusters` tab in the dashboard).

```
ml gnupg/2.2.19
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
gpg-agent --daemon --pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry
gpg --full-generate-key
```

and follow the instructions. You should use your UVA email address and select the RSA algorithm with size 4096 bits.

!!! tip

	If you plan on making commits using your UVA email persona from your personal system we recommend using the same GPG key. You can export and import GPG keys across machines.

!!! tip

	When working with Git in your personal system, we recommend using the [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (a GUI client). Students and educators can get a premium license for free! It also offers a GUI easy way to generate SSH/GPG keys and add them to GitHub.

### Adding the key to GitHub

Follow the [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account) from GitHub on how to register the GPG key.

You can make it the default and sign all your commits with it through

```
git config --global user.signingKey {gpg-key-ID}
git config --global commit.gpgSign true
```

## ~/.gitconfig

Your `~/.gitconfig` file should now look something like

```
[user]
	email = {computing_id}@virginia.edu
	name = {Full Legal Name (based on the GPG key step)}
	signingkey = {Your GPG key ID}
[credential]
	helper = cache
[gpg]
	program = gpg
[commit]
	gpgSign = true
```

You can edit the file to match the entries if any are missing.
