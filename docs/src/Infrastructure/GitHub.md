# Version Control / Hosting Platform

The Data Science for the Public Good Program will be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for software development platform. GitHub, a subsidiary of Microsoft, is the world's largest Git hosting platform. If you do not have yet a GitHub account, [register](https://github.com/join) for one. I recommend using your personal email address and adding your UVA email address as an additional verified email for that account.

!!! tip

    Your GitHub activity and presence is a strong signal of your online / scholar reputation. It is highly suggested that you fill out the optional profile (e.g., your real name, location, biography).

!!! tip

    You can get additional perks in GitHub such as the [Student Developer Pack](https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack).
    
!!! tip

    We encourage everyone to get the Student Developer Pack and complete the program to become a GitHub [Campus Expert](https://education.github.com/students/experts).

!!! tip

    As with most accounts, enable two factor security through Duo Mobile and store your credentials / recovery keys with LastPass. Both services available to all UVA qualifying faculty, staff, and students.
